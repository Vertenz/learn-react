# learn-react
This is my react training project. I'm getting a little bored with all usual staff like to-do list, input form, etc. That is exactly why I created This :)  
You can use the Adventure mode or Text version to see other my project.
 I used here React, functional components, react-router-dom, lazy, useEffect, useRef, useState
